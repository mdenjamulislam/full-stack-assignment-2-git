# 5 Topics about git & github
## Verson Control
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It is essential in software development, enabling multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes, maintaining a complete history of modifications, and facilitating the recovery of earlier versions if needed.

# Key Concepts of Version Control
### Repositories
A repository (or repo) is the central place where data is stored and managed. It includes the complete history of all changes made to the project files and metadata about those changes.

### Commits
A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Each commit records the changes made to the files, who made the changes, and a message describing the changes.

### Branches
Branches allow developers to diverge from the main line of development and continue to work on their changes independently. Once the work on a branch is complete, it can be merged back into the main branch.

### Merging
Merging is the process of taking changes from one branch and integrating them into another. This is how changes from different branches are combined into a single unified project.

### Conflicts
Conflicts occur when changes in different branches interfere with each other. These need to be resolved manually by the developer.
